# this is a simple theorem prover that uses the theorem map


# the theorem prover works by finding a path between nodes in the derivation graph (if possible)
# if a path is discovered, the theorems corresponding to each edge along the way can be applied
# they will by definition map from the desired premises to the desired conclusion
